// Australian ballots require that voters rank all the candidates in the order of
// choice. Initially only the first choices are counted, and if one candidate receives
// more than 50% of the vote than that candidate is elected. However, if no candidate
// receives more than 50%, all the candidates tied for the lowest number of votes are
// eliminated. Ballots ranking these candidates first are recounted in favor of their
// highest-ranked non-eliminated candidate. This process of eliminating the weakest
// candidates and counting their ballots in favor of their preferred non-eliminated
// candidate continues until one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, or until
// all remaining candidates are tied.
//
// ## Input
// The input consists of up to 20 `candidates` and up to 1,000 `ballots`. Each ballot
// contains the numbers from 1 to $n$ in some order. The first number indicates the
// candidate of the first choice; the second number indicates candidate of second
// choice, and so on.
//
// ## Output
// Return an array containing the names of the winners.
//
// ## Samples
