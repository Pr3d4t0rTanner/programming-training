// A popular but insecure method of encrypting text is to permute the letters of the
// alphabet. That is, in the text, each letter of the alphabet is consistently replaced
// by some other letter. To ensure that the encryption is reversible, no two letters are
// replaced by the same letter.
//
// A powerful method of cryptanalysis is the known plain text attack. In a known plain
// text attack, the cryptanalyst manages to have a known phrase or sentence encrypted by
// the enemy, and by observing the encrypted text then deduces the method of encoding.
//
// Your task is to decrypt several encrypted lines of text, assuming that each line uses
// the same set of replacements, and that one of the lines of input is encrypted form of
// the plain text _the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog_.
//
// ## Input
// The input contains several, encrypted as described above. The encrypted lines
// contain only lowercase letters and spaces and do not exceed 80 characters in length.
// There are at most 100 encrypted texts.
//
// ## Output
// For each encrypted text, decrypt it. If there is more than one possible decryption,
// any one will do. If decryption is impossible return null.
//
